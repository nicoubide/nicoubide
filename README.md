Hello, world!

Iâ€™m Nico Ubide. Iâ€™m an aspiring data scientist currently in the process of finishing my final year at the University of Pennsylvania. Welcome to my GitHub! Here youâ€™ll find a collection of some of my personal projects and homework assignments that Iâ€™m most proud of. These repos will be focused on data analytics and data engineering and, as a result, will mostly be written in Python and SQL. If you have any questions or general inquiries please feel free to reach out to me on any of the platforms below:
